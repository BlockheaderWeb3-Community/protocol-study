# Protocol Study Group - Research Task
The study group is divided into two specialized teams:

### Consensus Group
Research and document findings on the mechanisms that secure and finalize blocks in the protocol: 
    - Casper LMD-GHOST – Understand how the fork-choice rule works and its role in finality.
    - Checkpoint Sync – Investigate how the network ensures fast and efficient synchronization using checkpointing.
    - Consensus Specifications – Analyze the formal specifications governing the consensus layer.

### Submissions:
- Well-structured doc explaining each concept in simple terms with diagrams where necessary.


### Execution Group
Research and document findings on how transactions are processed and executed. Also research about the following:   
    - Gossip Protocol – Explore how transactions and blocks are propagated efficiently across the network.
    - Engine API – Study how execution clients interact with consensus clients.
    - Execution Specifications – Review the specifications that define how state transitions and block processing work.

### Submissions:
- structured report explaining each component, including technical insights and real-world implications.

PS: Diagrams or code snippets (where applicable) to illustrate key ideas.
